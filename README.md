# Predictive-IT-Service-Ticket-Resolution-Time
Building a regression model to predict the resolution time for IT service tickets.This model assists IT support teams in prioritizingÂ and efficiently resolving issues,improving overall service quality.
Predicting IT service ticket resolution time with machine learning improves service delivery by speeding up resolutions, enhancing customer satisfaction, and optimizing resource allocation. This leads to increased efficiency, cost savings, and better data-driven decision making, ultimately boosting business productivity and competitiveness.

The project aimed to predict IT service ticket resolution times using machine learning. I employed a linear regression model from Scikit-learn. The process involved:
Data Collection: Gathering historical IT ticket data, including historical resolution times, issue type, priority.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, Handling outliers and converting categorical features into numerical format.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features by performing one hot encoding  to improve model performance.
Data Visualization: Analysing the data through graphical visualizations.
Model Training: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the linear regression model to the training data.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared on the testing set.
Prediction: Using the trained model to predict resolution times for new tickets.
